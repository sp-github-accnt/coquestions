  "country": "US"
}

```

---

### pluck

---

### keyBy  
Implement a function `keyBy` that converts an array of associative arrays into a single associative array, re-indexing them by the specified associative key.

**Example:**  
```
Input:
[{"id":1,"name":"John"},{"id":2,"name":"Anna"}], key="id"
Output:
{ "1":{"id":1,"name":"John"}, "2":{"id":2,"name":"Anna"} }
```

---

### query  
Implement a function `query` that converts an associative array to a URL query string.

Don't use in-built function that works same as `query` function.

**Example:**  
```
Input: {"page":2,"search":"test"}  
Output: "page=2&search=test"
```

---

### sortRecursive  
Implement a function named `sortRecursive` sorting associative arrays by keys, recursively sorting sub-arrays as well.

Don't use in-built function that works same as `sortRecursive` function.

**Example:**  
```
Input: {"b":2,"a":{"d":4,"c":3}}  
Output: {"a":{"c":3,"d":4},"b":2}
```

---

### shuffle  
Implement a function `shuffle` randomly rearranging elements of an input array.  

Don't use in-built function that works same as `shuffle` function.

**Example (Possible Output):**  
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output (Possible): [3,1,4,5,2]
```

---

### random  
Implement the function `random`, which selects and returns one or more random elements from an array.

Don't use in-built function that works same as `random` function.

**Example:**  
```
Input: [1,2,3], count=2  
Possible Output: [2,3]
```

---

### data_fill  
Implement a function called `data_fill` to set values in nested associative arrays using "dot notation".  
(**Dot notation means writing nested keys separated by dots, e.g., "user.address.street"**).  
It sets value only if the key doesn't exist yet.

Don't use in-built function that works same as `data_fill` function.

**Example:**  
```
Input: {}, key="person.name", value="Alex"

### data_set  
Implement `data_set`, similar to Question #12, to set a value using the "dot notation". It overwrites existing values.

Don't use in-built function that works same as `data_set` function.

```
Input: {}, key="person.address.street", value="Main"  
Output: {"person":{"address":{"street":"Main"}}}
```

---

### data_forget  
Implement a function `data_forget` that removes value from nested associative array, using "dot notation".

Output: {"user":{"name":"Alex"}}
```

---

### prependKeysWith  
Implement `prependKeysWith` adding a given prefix to all keys of associative array.

Input: {"name":"Sam","city":"NY"}, prefix="user_"  
Output: {"user_name":"Sam","user_city":"NY"}
```

---

### collapse

### set  
Implement `set` function setting a value within nested associative arrays based on provided key using dot notation. If the nested structure doesn't exist, it should create it.

Don't use in-built function that works same as `set` function.

**Example:**  
```
Input: {}, key="address.city", value="Boston"  
Output: {"address":{"city":"Boston"}}
